# rust-bpf/bpf-tools

A collection of BPF tools implemented in Rust.

The goal is to provide tools like those found in the
[bcc repository](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc)

By providing equivalent and additional tools in Rust, we can gain advantages in
terms of runtime performance and the ability to produce static binaries. This
simplifies the usage of these tools in production environments.
